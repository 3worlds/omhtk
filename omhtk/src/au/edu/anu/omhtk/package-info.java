/**
 * <p>
 * A bunch of low-level utilities that developers keep re-coding in many
 * applications. In an ideal world this package should be replaced by
 * state-of-the-art well designed universal libraries dealing with all the
 * little problems appearing in this code. Unfortunately, developers keep
 * reinventing the wheel, either because the existing wheel is poorly
 * documented, or there are too many versions of it, or it is hidden in a crowd
 * of other classes one doesn't need - so why import the whole mess? We tried to
 * keep it light-weight and with as few dependencies as possible. If you think
 * that one of the classes in there can be advantageously replaced by an
 * existing one, please tell us and we will remove it.
 * </p>

 * Utilities initially developed at the Australian National University Research
 * School of Computer Science.
